1. *Set Up Your Project:*
   - Create a new directory for your project.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project (npm init -y).
   - Install necessary dependencies (npm install express mongoose react react-dom axios).

2. *Backend (Node.js with Express.js and MongoDB):*

   - Create a folder named backend.
   - Inside the backend folder, create files for your server (server.js) and your MongoDB models (e.g., Expense.js).
   - Set up your Express server in server.js.
   - Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose in server.js.
   - Define routes for handling CRUD operations on expenses (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
   - Implement controllers to handle business logic.
   - Define models for your expenses in Expense.js.

3. *Frontend (React.js):*

   - Create a folder named frontend.
   - Inside the frontend folder, create files for your React components.
   - Set up your React components to interact with the backend API using Axios or fetch.
   - Create components for displaying expenses, adding new expenses, editing existing expenses, and deleting expenses.
   - Use React Router for navigation between different views (e.g., a list of expenses and a form for adding/editing expenses).

4. *Styling:*

   - Style your frontend components using CSS or a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI.

5. *Testing:*

   - Test your application locally by running both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.
   - Use tools like Postman to test your backend API endpoints.
   - Manually test your frontend components to ensure they function as expected.

6. *Deployment:*

   - Deploy your backend to a platform like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
   - Deploy your frontend to a static hosting service like Netlify or Vercel.

7. *Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):*

   - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.
   - Use services like GitHub Actions or Travis CI for CI/CD.

Here's a basic example of how your project structure might look:


expense-tracker-app/
├── backend/
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── Expense.js
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   └── expenseController.js
│   └── routes/
│       └── expenseRoutes.js
└── frontend/
    ├── public/
    │   └── index.html
    ├── src/
    │   ├── components/
    │   │   ├── ExpenseList.js
    │   │   ├── AddExpenseForm.js
    │   │   ├── EditExpenseForm.js
    │   │   └── ExpenseItem.js
    │   ├── App.js
    │   └── index.js
    └── package.json


This is just a basic outline
